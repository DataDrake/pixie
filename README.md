**Pix**el **I**nteractive **E**ditor

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/DataDrake/pixie)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/DataDrake/pixie) [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/DataDrake/pixie.svg)]()

## Motivation

In preparation for a future Ludum Dare, I wanted a Pixel editor for doing Sprite design, animation, and tiling. I could have used a paid product, but decided this would be a good opportunity to learn the [Ebiten](https://ebiten.org/) game library, practice 2D UI design, and build my own tools. Thus, Pixie was born.

## Goals

 * Multiple Editors:
   * Sprites
   * Palettes
   * Sprite Animation
   * Map Tiling
 * Use a JSON format for all files
 * Be as easy to use as possible
 * A+ Rating on [Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/DataDrake/pixie)

## Requirements

* Go 1.15 (tested)
* OS-Specific Ebiten dependencies: [See Here](https://ebiten.org/documents/install.html)
* Make

## Installation

1. Clone repo and enter its directory
2. `make`
3. `sudo make install`

## Usage

Currently Pixie can only be used to draw a single Sprite and does not support saving (sorry!).
